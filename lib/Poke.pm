=head1 DESCRIPTION

Poke is a monitoring framework. It pokes things to see if they are alive and then reports back. It is intended to be used through its shiny little command 'poked' with a config file and some jobs. Poke comes with only a couple of simple jobs, but should be plenty for people that just want to do simple stats on uptime for a webservice. Results are stored in a database that you configure Poke to use. You can get a simple display of those results if you turn on the httpd.
